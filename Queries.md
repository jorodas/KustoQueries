# KustoQueries
## Sample Kusto Queries

This is a work in progress. Queries are provided as sample code, "as is" with no support

### SCOM Alert Queries
#### * Expose alerts with a specific criterion

Alert
| where AlertName containscs "CPU Utilization" and AlertSeverity == "Error"
| project TimeGenerated, AlertSeverity, SourceDisplayName, AlertName 
| sort by SourceDisplayName desc

### Service Health
//Sample Alerts from SCOM for a specific computername (dc)
Alert
| where AlertSeverity == "Error" and SourceDisplayName contains "dc"
| project TimeGenerated, AlertSeverity, SourceDisplayName, AlertName
| sort by SourceDisplayName desc


//Sample Service Health Queries
Event
| where EventLog == "System" and EventID == 7036 and Source == "Service Control Manager" and Computer contains "lms-dc" 
| parse kind=relaxed EventData with * '<Data Name="param1">' Windows_Service_Name '</Data><Data Name="param2">' Windows_Service_State '</Data>' *
| sort by TimeGenerated desc
| project Computer, Windows_Service_Name, Windows_Service_State, TimeGenerated

### Configuration Data
ConfigurationData
| where Computer contains "lms-dc-01" and SvcName =~ "spooler"
| project SvcName, SvcDisplayName, SvcState, TimeGenerated
//| where SvcState != "Running"


### Performance Queries
#### -	Top 10 processor utilization, you can rename the Y axis as needed

Perf 
| where ObjectName == "Processor"
| summarize Average_CPU = avg(CounterValue) by Computer, CounterName 
| where Average_CPU > 1
| render barchart

#### -	Similar query for disk latency

Perf 
| where CounterName == "Avg. Disk sec/Read" 
| summarize Average_Latency = avg(CounterValue) by Computer, CounterName 
| sort by Average_Latency desc


#### -	Overall Performance Data for the environment

Perf
| where TimeGenerated >=ago (7d)
| where ObjectName == "Processor"
| where CounterName == "% Processor Time"
| summarize avg(CounterValue) by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| render timechart

#### - Show me the top 10 computers with less than 1GB RAM available?
 
 Perf
| where CounterName == "Available MBytes" and  CounterValue <= 1024
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, CounterName, ObjectName, CounterValue 
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by Computer
| top 10 by CounterValue asc
 
You could drill down once you find the one using most of the resources and expose data quickly

#### top 3 drives with less than 90%

let PercentSpace = 90; //enter the threshold for the disk space percentage (remove comments for barchart)
Perf
| where ObjectName == "LogicalDisk" and CounterName == "% Free Space" and InstanceName == "C:"
| summarize FreeSpace = min(CounterValue) by Computer, InstanceName
| top 3 by FreeSpace
| where FreeSpace < PercentSpace
| project Computer, FreeSpace
| sort by FreeSpace asc
//| render barchart kind = unstacked


#### -	Perf data for all our the computers we have

let endTime=now();
let timerange =1d;
let startTime=now() - timerange;
let mInterval=4;
let mAvgParm= repeat(1, mInterval);
Perf
| where ObjectName == "Processor"
| where CounterName == "% Processor Time"
| make-series avgCpu=avg(CounterValue)  default=0 on TimeGenerated in range(startTime, endTime, 15m) by Computer
| extend moving_avgCpu = series_fir(avgCpu, mAvgParm) 
| render timechart

 
You could highlight the one you see using most data

#### -	Perf data delta for 1 wk
let ProcessorBefore = Perf
| where TimeGenerated between(ago(7d) .. ago(1d))
| where ObjectName == "Processor" and CounterName == "% Processor Time" and InstanceName == "_Total"
| summarize ValueBefore = avg(CounterValue) by Computer;
let CurrentProcessor = Perf
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
| where ObjectName == "Processor" and CounterName == "% Processor Time" and InstanceName == "_Total"
| summarize CurrentValue = avg(CounterValue) by Computer;
ProcessorBefore | join kind= inner (
 CurrentProcessor 
) on Computer
| project-away Computer1
| extend Difference = (CurrentValue - ValueBefore)

#### -	Compare perf data between computer groups

Perf
| where ObjectName == "Processor"
| where CounterName == "% Processor Time"
| extend group = case(Computer startswith "apm01", "Application Performance Monitoring", Computer startswith "dc", "dc", "Domain Controllers")
| summarize avg(CounterValue) by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h), group
| render timechart

 
You can see perf data per groups, however, I need to work on this one, I can see both groups, but need to work on the case statement

#### -	show me the top 5 logical drives by free space? (optional filter by drive)
let PercentSpace = 90;
Perf
| where ObjectName == "LogicalDisk" and CounterName == "% Free Space"
| summarize FreeSpace = min(CounterValue) by Computer, InstanceName
//| where InstanceName == "C:"
| where InstanceName contains ":"
| where FreeSpace < PercentSpace
| sort by FreeSpace asc
| take 5

SecurityEvent
| project  Activity
| parse Activity with activityID " - " activityDesc
| summarize count() by activityID

#### -	When was the last time a specific computer was rebooted?

| where Computer containscs "clt" and  EventID == 6005 and EventLog == "System" and Source == "EventLog"
| project Computer, TimeGenerated 
| sort by Computer
